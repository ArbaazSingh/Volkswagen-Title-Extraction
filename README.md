# Volkswagen-Title-Extraction
This project is to extract title information for the various Volkswagen repair documents. The documents crawled have incomplete information as to their titles. This code takes input the OE path of the document and returns the correct title for the document, that contains all the required information to make the title unique.

To extract all languages together, use VolkswagenAll. Language-Specific Codes have also been added.
